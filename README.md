Implementation of an algorithm that reads a set of n rooted trees in the NEWICK format, then for each of n(n-1)/2 pairs of trees calculates the minimum number of leaves whose removal from both trees will make them isomorphic.
In IT this problem is known as [Maximum agreement subtree problem.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_agreement_subtree_problem "Maximum agreement subtree problem.")
